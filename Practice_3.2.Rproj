##  Step 1: Create the initial data frame
```
library(dplyr)


subject_names <- c("Subject1", "Subject2", "Subject3", "Subject4", "Subject5")
initial_weight <- c(104,95,87,77,112)
post_diet_weight <- c(96,91,81,75,118)

bubble_diet_df <- data.frame(Subject = subject_names,
                             Before_Diet = initial_weight,
                             After_Diet = post_diet_weight)

```

## Step 2: Reformat the data frame

```

bubble_diet_df_reformatted <- bubble_diet_df %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = -Subject, 
               names_to = "Measurement_Time",
               values_to = "Weight")
```
## Step 3: Calculate weight loss as a percentage
```
bubble_diet_df_reformatted <- bubble_diet_df_reformatted %>%
  group_by(Subject) %>%
  mutate(Weight_Loss = ((Weight - min(Weight)) / min(Weight)) * 100) %>%
ungroup()
```

## Step 4: Create the list as specified
```



BUBBLE_DIET <- list(
  Data_Frame = bubble_diet_df_reformatted,
  WEIGHT_LOSS = list(
    Row_Names = row.names(bubble_diet_df_reformatted),
    Weight_Loss_Percentage = bubble_diet_df_reformatted$Weight_Loss,
    Weight_Loss_Table = data.frame(
      Subject = bubble_diet_df_reformatted$Subject,
      Weight_Loss = bubble_diet_df_reformatted$Weight_Loss
    )
  ),
  Message = "I enjoy manipulating data in R."
)

# View the resulting list
BUBBLE_DIET

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
